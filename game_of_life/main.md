# Conway's Game of life

Objective: Show that LLMs/GPT4 is able to perform step-wise simulations

[system_prompt](system_prompt) (in the current version, with latex instructions) was run with [human_prompt](human_prompt). This led to the correct simulation.

See file [ai_message](ai_message) for the final result. Timeouts were indicated with <TIMEOUT>

[latex_output](latex_output) contains the latex outputs manually copied from the ai_message.

A python-based simulation of game of life (written by GPT4 as well) can be found in [game_of_life_simulator.py](game_of_life_simulator.py)
