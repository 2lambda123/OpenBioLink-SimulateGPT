  Computational simulation of biological processes can be a
  valuable tool in accelerating biomedical research, but
  usually requires extensive domain knowledge and manual
  adaptation. Recently, large language models (LLMs) such as
  GPT-4 have proven surprisingly successful for a wide range
  of tasks by generating human language at a very large
  scale. Here we explore the potential of leveraging LLMs as
  simulators of biological systems. We establish
  proof-of-concept of a text-based simulator, SimulateGPT,
  that uses LLM reasoning. We demonstrate good prediction
  performance for various biomedical applications, without
  requiring explicit domain knowledge or manual tuning. LLMs
  thus enable a new class of versatile and broadly
  applicable biological simulators. This text-based
  simulation paradigm is well-suited for modeling and
  understanding complex living systems that are difficult to
  describe with physics-based first-principles simulation,
  but for which extensive knowledge and context is available
  as written text.
