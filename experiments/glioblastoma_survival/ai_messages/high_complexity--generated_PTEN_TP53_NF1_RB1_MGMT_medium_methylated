parameters:
  - glioblastoma diagnosis
  - PTEN mutations
  - TP53 mutations
  - NF1 mutations
  - RB1 mutations
  - MGMT methylation status: medium
  - MUC16: no mutations
  - EGFR: no mutations
  - PIK3CA: no mutations
  - standard of care with genotype-informed treatment

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with a median overall survival of 15 months [1]. PTEN, TP53, NF1, and RB1 are tumor suppressor genes, and their mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor progression [2]. MGMT methylation status affects the response to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy drug for glioblastoma [3]. MUC16, EGFR, and PIK3CA are not mutated in this case.
    entities: PTEN, TP53, NF1, RB1, MGMT, MUC16, EGFR, PIK3CA, temozolomide
    assumptions: The patient receives standard of care with genotype-informed treatment, which includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. The presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene mutations may influence the tumor's aggressiveness and response to treatment.
    consequence: increased tumor aggressiveness and altered response to temozolomide
    probability: 80
    explanation: The presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene mutations is likely to result in a more aggressive tumor and may affect the response to temozolomide due to the medium MGMT methylation status.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor suppressor gene mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, angiogenesis, and invasion [2]. Temozolomide is an alkylating agent that induces DNA damage and cell death, but its efficacy can be reduced in tumors with medium MGMT methylation status [3].
    entities: tumor cells, blood vessels, temozolomide, MGMT
    assumptions: The tumor cells have increased aggressiveness due to the presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene mutations. The medium MGMT methylation status may reduce the efficacy of temozolomide.
    consequence: increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion; reduced response to temozolomide
    probability: 75
    explanation: The presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene mutations is likely to result in increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion. The medium MGMT methylation status may reduce the response to temozolomide.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: decreased survival, -4 months
  explanation: The presence of multiple tumor suppressor gene mutations and medium MGMT methylation status is likely to result in increased tumor aggressiveness and reduced response to temozolomide, leading to a decreased survival of 4 months relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival of 15 months.
