conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: 'decreased'
    survival_deviation_months: -4
  explanation: The patient has a glioblastoma with an EGFR mutation and low MGMT methylation status. EGFR mutations are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype, while low MGMT methylation status reduces the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy (temozolomide). These factors contribute to a decreased survival relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival, with an estimated deviation of 4 months.
