parameters:
  - glioblastoma diagnosis
  - PIK3CA mutations
  - MGMT methylation status: high
  - EGFR: no mutations
  - TP53: no mutations
  - NF1: no mutations
  - MUC16: no mutations
  - PTEN: no mutations
  - RB1: no mutations
  - standard of care with genotype-informed treatment

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: PIK3CA mutations are associated with increased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival [1]. High MGMT methylation status is associated with improved response to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy drug for glioblastoma [2].
    entities: PIK3CA, MGMT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, temozolomide
    assumptions: The patient receives standard of care treatment, including temozolomide, and the genotype-informed treatment takes into account the PIK3CA mutations and MGMT methylation status.
    consequence: increased sensitivity to temozolomide, increased cell proliferation and survival due to PIK3CA mutations
    probability: 80
    explanation: The high MGMT methylation status increases the patient's sensitivity to temozolomide, while the PIK3CA mutations may promote tumor growth and survival.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Glioblastoma cells with PIK3CA mutations may be more resistant to apoptosis and have increased invasive potential [3]. Temozolomide treatment can induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, especially in those with high MGMT methylation status [4].
    entities: glioblastoma cells, apoptosis, invasive potential, temozolomide
    assumptions: The patient's glioblastoma cells have PIK3CA mutations and high MGMT methylation status, and they receive temozolomide treatment.
    consequence: increased apoptosis in glioblastoma cells due to temozolomide, increased invasive potential due to PIK3CA mutations
    probability: 70
    explanation: Temozolomide treatment may induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells with high MGMT methylation status, while PIK3CA mutations may increase the invasive potential of the tumor.
    novelty: 30

conclusion:
  outcome: increased survival, +3 months
  explanation: The patient's high MGMT methylation status suggests an increased sensitivity to temozolomide, which may improve their response to treatment and extend their survival. However, the presence of PIK3CA mutations may promote tumor growth and invasive potential, which could counteract some of the benefits of temozolomide treatment. Overall, the patient's survival is more likely to be increased relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival (15 months) by an estimated 3 months.
