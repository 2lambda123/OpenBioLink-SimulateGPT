parameters:
  - glioblastoma diagnosis
  - genetic alterations:
    - PTEN: mutations found
    - MGMT methylation status: medium
    - EGFR: no mutations found
    - TP53: no mutations found
    - PIK3CA: no mutations found
    - NF1: no mutations found
    - MUC16: no mutations found
    - RB1: no mutations found
  - standard of care with genotype-informed treatment

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is involved in cell growth, survival, and metabolism [1]. MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine, and its methylation status can affect the response to alkylating agents like temozolomide [2]. EGFR, TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, MUC16, and RB1 are other genes that can be mutated in glioblastoma, but they are not mutated in this patient [3].
    entities: PTEN, MGMT, EGFR, TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, MUC16, RB1, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
    assumptions: The patient's glioblastoma has PTEN mutations and medium MGMT methylation status, which may affect the tumor's response to treatment.
    consequence: decreased PTEN function, altered MGMT methylation status
    probability: 100
    explanation: The presence of PTEN mutations and medium MGMT methylation status in the patient's glioblastoma will likely lead to decreased PTEN function and altered MGMT methylation status.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Loss of PTEN function can lead to increased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting cell growth, survival, and metabolism [1]. Medium MGMT methylation status may result in a partial response to alkylating agents like temozolomide [2].
    entities: PTEN, MGMT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, temozolomide
    assumptions: The decreased PTEN function and altered MGMT methylation status will affect the cellular processes in the glioblastoma.
    consequence: increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation, partial response to temozolomide
    probability: 90
    explanation: The decreased PTEN function may lead to increased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting cell growth and survival, while the medium MGMT methylation status may result in a partial response to temozolomide.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor with a poor prognosis [4]. Standard of care includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide [5]. Genotype-informed treatment may involve targeted therapies for specific genetic alterations [6].
    entities: glioblastoma, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, temozolomide, targeted therapies
    assumptions: The patient will receive standard of care with genotype-informed treatment, which may be influenced by the genetic alterations in their glioblastoma.
    consequence: potential benefit from targeted therapies, partial response to temozolomide
    probability: 70
    explanation: The patient may benefit from targeted therapies due to the genetic alterations in their glioblastoma, but the medium MGMT methylation status may result in a partial response to temozolomide.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: increased survival, +3 months
  explanation: The patient's glioblastoma has genetic alterations that may allow for genotype-informed treatment, potentially increasing their survival by a few months. However, the medium MGMT methylation status may result in a partial response to temozolomide, limiting the overall survival benefit.
