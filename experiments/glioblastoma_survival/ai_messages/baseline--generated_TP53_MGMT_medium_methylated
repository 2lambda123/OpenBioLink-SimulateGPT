conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation_months: 3
  explanation: The patient has a TP53 mutation and medium MGMT methylation status. TP53 mutations are common in glioblastomas and do not significantly impact survival. However, medium MGMT methylation status is associated with a better response to temozolomide, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug. This improved response may lead to a modest increase in overall survival compared to the median glioblastoma survival of 15 months.
