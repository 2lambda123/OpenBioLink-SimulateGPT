conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: 'decreased'
    survival_deviation_months: -4
  explanation: The presence of PTEN and NF1 mutations in the glioblastoma may lead to a more aggressive tumor and poorer prognosis. Additionally, low MGMT methylation status is associated with reduced responsiveness to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy for glioblastoma. These factors combined suggest a decreased survival relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival, with an estimated deviation of 4 months.
