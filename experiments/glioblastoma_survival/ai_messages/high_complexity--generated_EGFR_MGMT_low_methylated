parameters:
  - glioblastoma diagnosis
  - EGFR mutations
  - MGMT methylation status: low
  - TP53: no mutations
  - PIK3CA: no mutations
  - NF1: no mutations
  - MUC16: no mutations
  - PTEN: no mutations
  - RB1: no mutations
  - standard of care with genotype-informed treatment

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: EGFR mutations are common in glioblastoma and are associated with poor prognosis [1]. Low MGMT methylation status is associated with resistance to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy drug for glioblastoma [2].
    entities: EGFR, MGMT
    assumptions: The patient's glioblastoma has EGFR mutations and low MGMT methylation status, which may affect their response to standard treatments.
    consequence: decreased sensitivity to temozolomide due to low MGMT methylation status
    probability: 80
    explanation: Low MGMT methylation status is known to be associated with resistance to temozolomide, which is a standard treatment for glioblastoma [2].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: EGFR mutations can lead to increased cell proliferation and survival in glioblastoma [1]. Standard of care for glioblastoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide [3].
    entities: glioblastoma cells, EGFR, temozolomide
    assumptions: The patient's glioblastoma cells have EGFR mutations, which may contribute to tumor progression. The patient is receiving standard of care treatment, including temozolomide.
    consequence: increased tumor progression due to EGFR mutations
    probability: 70
    explanation: EGFR mutations are known to contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in glioblastoma, which can lead to faster tumor progression [1].
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: decreased survival, -4 months
  explanation: The patient's glioblastoma has EGFR mutations and low MGMT methylation status, which are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to temozolomide, respectively. This may lead to decreased survival relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival of 15 months.
