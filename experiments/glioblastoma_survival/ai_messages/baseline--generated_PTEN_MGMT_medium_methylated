conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation: 3
  explanation: The patient has a PTEN mutation and medium MGMT methylation status. PTEN mutations are associated with a worse prognosis, but medium MGMT methylation status suggests a better response to temozolomide chemotherapy, which is part of the standard of care for glioblastoma. The absence of other mutations, such as EGFR, TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, MUC16, and RB1, may also contribute to a slightly better outcome. Overall, the patient's survival is likely to be increased relative to the median glioblastoma survival by approximately 3 months.
