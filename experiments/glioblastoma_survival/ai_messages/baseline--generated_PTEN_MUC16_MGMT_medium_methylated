conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation_months: 3
  explanation: The presence of PTEN and MUC16 mutations may contribute to tumor progression, but the medium MGMT methylation status suggests a better response to temozolomide chemotherapy, which is part of the standard of care for glioblastoma. The absence of mutations in EGFR, TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, and RB1 may also be favorable for the patient. Considering these factors, the patient's survival is more likely to be increased relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival (15 months) by an estimated 3 months.
