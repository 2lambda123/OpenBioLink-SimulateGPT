conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation_months: 3
  explanation: The patient has a mutation in the NF1 gene and medium MGMT methylation status. While NF1 mutations are associated with poorer prognosis, medium MGMT methylation status suggests a better response to temozolomide chemotherapy, which is part of the standard of care for glioblastoma. The absence of other detrimental mutations (e.g., EGFR, TP53, PIK3CA, MUC16, PTEN, and RB1) may also contribute to a slightly better outcome. Therefore, the patient's survival is more likely to be increased relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival (15 months) by an estimated 3 months.
