conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation_months: 6
  explanation: The patient's glioblastoma has a PIK3CA mutation and high MGMT methylation status. The high MGMT methylation status is associated with a better response to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy drug for glioblastoma, which may lead to increased survival. The PIK3CA mutation may be targetable with genotype-informed treatment, such as PI3K inhibitors, which could further improve the patient's prognosis. However, the absence of mutations in other genes like EGFR, TP53, NF1, MUC16, PTEN, and RB1 reduces the number of potential targeted therapies. Based on these factors, the patient's survival is more likely to be increased relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival (15 months) by an estimated 6 months.
