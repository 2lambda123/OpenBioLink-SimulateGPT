conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation: 3
  explanation: The presence of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations may contribute to tumor progression, but the medium MGMT methylation status suggests a better response to temozolomide, a standard-of-care chemotherapy for glioblastoma. This could lead to a modest increase in overall survival relative to the median. The absence of mutations in other genes such as EGFR, NF1, MUC16, PTEN, and RB1 may also contribute to a slightly better prognosis.
