conclusion:
  outcome:
    survival_relative_to_median: increased
    survival_deviation_months: 6
  explanation: The patient has mutations in PTEN and EGFR, which are commonly associated with glioblastoma. However, the high MGMT methylation status suggests a better response to temozolomide, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug. This factor may increase the patient's survival relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival. The absence of mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, MUC16, and RB1 may also contribute to a more favorable prognosis. Based on these factors, the patient's survival is estimated to be increased by 6 months relative to the median survival of 15 months.
