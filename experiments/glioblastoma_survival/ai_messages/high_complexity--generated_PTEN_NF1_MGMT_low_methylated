parameters:
  - glioblastoma diagnosis
  - PTEN mutations
  - NF1 mutations
  - MGMT methylation status: low
  - EGFR: no mutations
  - TP53: no mutations
  - PIK3CA: no mutations
  - MUC16: no mutations
  - RB1: no mutations
  - standard of care with genotype-informed treatment

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: PTEN and NF1 are tumor suppressor genes, and their mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation [1]. Low MGMT methylation status is associated with a poorer response to temozolomide, a standard chemotherapy drug for glioblastoma [2].
    entities: PTEN, NF1, MGMT, temozolomide
    assumptions: The patient's glioblastoma has PTEN and NF1 mutations, which contribute to tumor progression. Low MGMT methylation status reduces the effectiveness of temozolomide treatment.
    consequence: increased tumor progression and reduced response to temozolomide
    probability: 80
    explanation: PTEN and NF1 mutations are known to contribute to tumor progression, and low MGMT methylation status is associated with a poorer response to temozolomide treatment.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor with a poor prognosis [3]. Standard of care includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide [4]. Genotype-informed treatment may include targeted therapies or immunotherapies based on the specific genetic alterations present in the tumor [5].
    entities: glioblastoma, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, temozolomide, targeted therapies, immunotherapies
    assumptions: The patient receives standard of care treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Genotype-informed treatment may be considered based on the identified genetic alterations.
    consequence: partial tumor removal and control, but limited response to temozolomide due to low MGMT methylation status
    probability: 70
    explanation: Standard of care treatment can help control tumor growth, but the patient's low MGMT methylation status may limit the effectiveness of temozolomide.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: decreased, -4 months
  explanation: The patient's glioblastoma has PTEN and NF1 mutations, which contribute to tumor progression, and low MGMT methylation status, which is associated with a poorer response to temozolomide treatment. These factors suggest a decreased survival relative to the median overall glioblastoma survival of 15 months. We estimate a deviation of -4 months from the median survival.
