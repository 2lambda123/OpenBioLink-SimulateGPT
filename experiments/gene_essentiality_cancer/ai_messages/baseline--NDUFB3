conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: NDUFB3 is a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation. While it plays a role in cellular energy production, it is not directly associated with cancer cell survival or proliferation. Therefore, it is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines. However, it is important to note that the essentiality of a gene can vary depending on the specific cancer type and context.
