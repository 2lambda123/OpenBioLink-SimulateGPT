parameters:
  - gene: RPL27
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: RPL27 encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome [1]. Ribosomal proteins are essential for protein synthesis, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer [2]. RPL27 has been reported to be overexpressed in some cancer types, such as colorectal cancer [3].
    entities: RPL27, ribosomal protein, 60S ribosomal subunit, protein synthesis, cancer
    assumptions: RPL27 is involved in protein synthesis as a component of the ribosome. Its dysregulation may contribute to cancer development or progression.
    consequence: increased RPL27 expression in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the role of RPL27 in protein synthesis and its overexpression in some cancer types, it is likely that RPL27 expression is increased in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Essential genes are those that are required for the survival or reproduction of an organism or cell [4]. In cancer cell-lines, essential genes are often involved in processes that are critical for cell growth and proliferation [5].
    entities: essential genes, cancer cell-lines, cell growth, cell proliferation
    assumptions: RPL27 is involved in protein synthesis, which is critical for cell growth and proliferation. If RPL27 is essential for cancer cell-lines, its inhibition or loss should lead to reduced cell viability or growth.
    consequence: reduced cancer cell-line viability or growth upon RPL27 inhibition or loss
    probability: 70
    explanation: Since RPL27 is involved in protein synthesis, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation, it is plausible that its inhibition or loss would lead to reduced viability or growth in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 30

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the role of RPL27 in protein synthesis and its potential involvement in cancer development or progression, it is likely that RPL27 is essential in cancer cell-lines. Its inhibition or loss may lead to reduced cell viability or growth, suggesting its importance for cancer cell survival or proliferation.
