parameters:
  - gene: POLR3H
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: POLR3H encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs and 5S rRNA [1]. RNA polymerase III is essential for cell growth and proliferation [2]. However, the specific role of POLR3H in cancer cell-lines has not been extensively studied.
    entities: POLR3H, RNA polymerase III, tRNAs, 5S rRNA
    assumptions: POLR3H is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, which are essential for cell growth and proliferation. Cancer cell-lines require cell growth and proliferation for survival.
    consequence: POLR3H is likely essential for the survival of cancer cell-lines.
    probability: 70
    explanation: Given the role of POLR3H in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs and the importance of these RNAs in cell growth and proliferation, it is likely that POLR3H is essential for the survival of cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 50

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the role of POLR3H in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs and the importance of these RNAs in cell growth and proliferation, it is likely that POLR3H is essential for the survival of cancer cell-lines.
