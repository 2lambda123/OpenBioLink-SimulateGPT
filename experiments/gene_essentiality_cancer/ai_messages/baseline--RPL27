conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: RPL27 is a ribosomal protein gene, which is involved in protein synthesis. Although ribosomal proteins are essential for cell survival, they are not specifically essential for cancer cell-lines. Cancer cells may have increased protein synthesis demands, but RPL27 is not a direct driver of cancer development or progression.
