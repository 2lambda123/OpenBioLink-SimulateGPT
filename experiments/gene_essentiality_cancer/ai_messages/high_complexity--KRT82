parameters:
  - gene: KRT82
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: KRT82 (Keratin 82) is a type II keratin, which is a component of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in epithelial cells [1]. Keratins are involved in various cellular functions, including cell shape maintenance, mechanical resilience, and intracellular signaling [2]. However, KRT82 is specifically expressed in the hair follicle and is not known to be involved in cancer-related pathways [3].
    entities: KRT82, keratin, intermediate filament cytoskeleton, epithelial cells, hair follicle
    assumptions: KRT82 expression is limited to hair follicles and is not involved in cancer-related pathways.
    consequence: KRT82 is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    probability: 90
    explanation: Given the specific expression of KRT82 in hair follicles and its lack of involvement in cancer-related pathways, it is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the specific expression of KRT82 in hair follicles and its lack of involvement in cancer-related pathways, it is unlikely that KRT82 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
