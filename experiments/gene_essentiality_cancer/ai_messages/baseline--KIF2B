conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: KIF2B (Kinesin Family Member 2B) is a member of the kinesin-13 family, which plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and cell division. Abnormalities in microtubule dynamics and cell division are often associated with cancer development and progression. Therefore, KIF2B is likely essential in cancer cell-lines due to its involvement in these critical cellular processes.
