simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: S100A7A expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: S100A7A, also known as psoriasin, is a member of the S100 family of proteins and has been reported to be overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and skin cancer. However, its expression may vary depending on the specific cancer cell line.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: S100A7A involvement in cancer-related pathways
    probability: 70
    explanation: S100A7A has been implicated in several cancer-related pathways, such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. It can interact with various proteins, such as RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and annexin A2, to modulate these processes. However, the extent of its involvement in these pathways may vary depending on the cancer type and stage.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: S100A7A essentiality in cancer cell survival
    probability: 50
    explanation: While S100A7A has been implicated in various cancer-related processes, its essentiality for cancer cell survival is not well-established. Some studies have shown that knocking down S100A7A expression can reduce cancer cell growth and migration, but it is unclear if this effect is universal across all cancer cell lines or if it is specific to certain types of cancer.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Although S100A7A is overexpressed in various cancer types and involved in cancer-related pathways, its essentiality for cancer cell survival is not well-established. The available evidence suggests that it may play a role in cancer progression, but it is unlikely to be essential in all cancer cell lines.
