simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: KRT26 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: KRT26 (Keratin 26) is a type I intermediate filament protein, which is involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Its expression in cancer cell lines is variable, depending on the tissue origin and the specific cancer type.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: KRT26 role in cancer cell survival and proliferation
    probability: 40
    explanation: While KRT26 is involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells, its direct role in cancer cell survival and proliferation is not well-established. Some studies have reported altered expression of KRT26 in certain cancer types, but its functional significance in cancer progression remains unclear.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: KRT26 essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 30
    explanation: Given the limited evidence on the direct involvement of KRT26 in cancer cell survival and proliferation, it is difficult to determine its essentiality in cancer cell lines. However, considering that KRT26 is not a well-established oncogene or tumor suppressor, its essentiality in cancer cell lines is less likely compared to other well-known cancer-related genes.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the available evidence, KRT26 is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell lines, as its direct role in cancer cell survival and proliferation is not well-established.
