conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: The CCT5 gene encodes a subunit of the chaperonin-containing T-complex (CCT), which is involved in protein folding. While it plays a role in cellular processes, it is not considered a key driver of cancer development or progression. Therefore, it is unlikely that the CCT5 gene is essential in cancer cell-lines. However, it is important to note that the essentiality of a gene can vary depending on the specific cancer type and context.
