conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: PSMB7 (Proteasome Subunit Beta 7) is a component of the 20S proteasome, which is involved in protein degradation. While the proteasome plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, it is not specifically essential for cancer cell survival. However, cancer cells may have increased proteasome activity to cope with higher protein turnover. Inhibiting the proteasome can be a therapeutic strategy for some cancers, but PSMB7 itself is not likely essential in cancer cell-lines.
