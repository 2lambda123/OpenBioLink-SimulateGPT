conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: The GK2 gene, also known as glycerol kinase 2, is not commonly reported as an essential gene in cancer cell lines. Essential genes in cancer cells are typically those involved in cell proliferation, survival, and other critical cellular processes. While GK2 plays a role in glycerol metabolism, it is not considered a key player in cancer cell survival or growth. However, it is important to note that the essentiality of a gene can vary depending on the specific cancer type and context.
