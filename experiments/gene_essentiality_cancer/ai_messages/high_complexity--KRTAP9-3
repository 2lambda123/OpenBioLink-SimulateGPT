parameters:
  - gene: KRTAP9-3
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: KRTAP9-3, also known as Keratin Associated Protein 9-3, is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which is involved in the formation of hair and nails [1]. KAP proteins are associated with keratin intermediate filaments and contribute to the structure and mechanical properties of hair fibers [2]. There is limited information on the role of KRTAP9-3 in cancer.
    entities: KRTAP9-3, keratin-associated protein family, keratin intermediate filaments
    assumptions: KRTAP9-3 is primarily involved in hair and nail formation, and its role in cancer is not well-established.
    consequence: KRTAP9-3 is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the primary function of KRTAP9-3 in hair and nail formation, it is less likely to be essential in cancer cell-lines. However, the limited information on its role in cancer leaves some uncertainty.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the primary function of KRTAP9-3 in hair and nail formation and the limited information on its role in cancer, it is unlikely that KRTAP9-3 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
