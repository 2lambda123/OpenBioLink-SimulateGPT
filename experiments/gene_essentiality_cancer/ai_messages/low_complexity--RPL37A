simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: RPL37A expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: RPL37A is a ribosomal protein gene that is involved in protein synthesis. It is expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: RPL37A involvement in ribosome biogenesis
    probability: 100
    explanation: RPL37A encodes a component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: cancer cell dependency on protein synthesis
    probability: 100
    explanation: Cancer cells have a high demand for protein synthesis due to their rapid growth and proliferation. Therefore, they are highly dependent on ribosome biogenesis and function.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: RPL37A essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the importance of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in cancer cells, it is likely that RPL37A is essential for their survival and proliferation. However, some cancer cell lines may have developed alternative mechanisms or compensatory pathways to maintain protein synthesis in the absence of RPL37A.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the simulation, RPL37A is likely essential in cancer cell lines due to its role in ribosome biogenesis and the high dependency of cancer cells on protein synthesis. However, the probability is not 100% as some cancer cell lines may have developed alternative mechanisms or compensatory pathways.
