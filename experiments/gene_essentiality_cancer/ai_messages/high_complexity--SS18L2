parameters:
  - gene: SS18L2
  - context: cancer cell-lines

  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: SS18L2, also known as CREST, is a calcium-responsive transactivator that plays a role in neuronal development and synapse formation [1]. It has been reported to be involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CBP [2]. There is limited information on the direct involvement of SS18L2 in cancer.
    entities: SS18L2, CBP
    assumptions: SS18L2 may have a role in cancer cell-lines through its interaction with CBP and regulation of gene expression.
    consequence: altered SS18L2 expression or function in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: Given the limited information on SS18L2's involvement in cancer, it is uncertain whether its expression or function is altered in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Essential genes are those that are critical for the survival and proliferation of cells, and their loss or inhibition often leads to cell death or growth arrest [3]. In cancer cell-lines, essential genes are often involved in processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and cell survival pathways [4].
    entities: essential genes, cancer cell-lines, cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, cell survival pathways
    assumptions: If SS18L2 is essential in cancer cell-lines, it should be involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, or cell survival pathways.
    consequence: SS18L2 involvement in critical cellular processes in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 40
    explanation: While SS18L2 is involved in gene regulation, there is limited evidence linking it to critical cellular processes in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the limited information on SS18L2's involvement in cancer and its uncertain role in critical cellular processes, it is unlikely that SS18L2 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
