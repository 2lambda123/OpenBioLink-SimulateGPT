simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: RPL7A expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: RPL7A is a ribosomal protein gene that encodes a component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome. It is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, including cancer cell lines, as it is involved in the essential process of protein synthesis.

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    consequence: RPL7A knockdown affects protein synthesis
    probability: 95
    explanation: Since RPL7A is a component of the ribosome, its knockdown or inhibition would likely impair protein synthesis in the cell. This could lead to a reduction in the overall protein production, which is essential for cell growth and survival.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: cancer cell lines are sensitive to RPL7A knockdown
    probability: 70
    explanation: Cancer cells often have increased protein synthesis rates to support their rapid growth and proliferation. As a result, they may be more sensitive to disruptions in protein synthesis, such as those caused by RPL7A knockdown. However, the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to RPL7A knockdown may vary depending on the specific type of cancer and other genetic factors.

  - step: 4
    level: organism
    consequence: RPL7A essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the importance of RPL7A in protein synthesis and the potential sensitivity of cancer cell lines to disruptions in this process, it is likely that RPL7A is essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cell lines. However, the degree of essentiality may vary depending on the specific cancer type and genetic background.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the simulation, RPL7A is likely essential in cancer cell lines due to its role in protein synthesis and the potential sensitivity of cancer cells to disruptions in this process. However, the degree of essentiality may vary depending on the specific cancer type and genetic background.
