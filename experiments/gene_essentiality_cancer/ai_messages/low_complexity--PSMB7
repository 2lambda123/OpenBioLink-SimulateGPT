simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: PSMB7 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: PSMB7 is a gene that encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is involved in protein degradation. It is expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: increased proteasome activity in cancer cells
    probability: 80
    explanation: Cancer cells often exhibit increased proteasome activity to maintain their rapid growth and survival. PSMB7, as a component of the 20S proteasome, may contribute to this increased activity.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: dependence on proteasome function for survival
    probability: 75
    explanation: Cancer cells rely on proteasome function to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins and to regulate cell cycle progression. Inhibition of proteasome activity can lead to the accumulation of toxic proteins and cell death.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: PSMB7 essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 60
    explanation: Given the importance of proteasome function in cancer cell survival, it is plausible that PSMB7, as a component of the 20S proteasome, may be essential for the survival of some cancer cell lines.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the simulation, it is likely that the PSMB7 gene is essential in cancer cell lines due to its role in the 20S proteasome and the importance of proteasome function for cancer cell survival.
