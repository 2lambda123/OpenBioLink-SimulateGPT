parameters:
  - gene: SDR9C7
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: SDR9C7 (short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7) is a member of the SDR family, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including steroids, fatty acids, and retinoids [1]. The specific function of SDR9C7 is not well characterized, but it has been suggested to play a role in the metabolism of retinoids [2]. Retinoids are known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which are processes often dysregulated in cancer [3].
    entities: SDR9C7, SDR family, steroids, fatty acids, retinoids, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis
    assumptions: SDR9C7 may be involved in the metabolism of retinoids, which can influence cancer-related processes.
    consequence: potential involvement of SDR9C7 in cancer-related processes
    probability: 60
    explanation: The involvement of SDR9C7 in retinoid metabolism suggests a possible connection to cancer-related processes, but the specific function of SDR9C7 is not well characterized.
    novelty: 50

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Essential genes are those that are required for the survival or reproduction of an organism or cell [4]. In cancer cell lines, essential genes are often involved in processes that are critical for cell survival, such as DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and energy metabolism [5].
    entities: essential genes, DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, energy metabolism
    assumptions: If SDR9C7 is essential in cancer cell lines, it should be involved in critical cellular processes.
    consequence: SDR9C7 is not directly involved in critical cellular processes
    probability: 80
    explanation: While SDR9C7 may be involved in retinoid metabolism, which can influence cancer-related processes, it is not directly involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, or energy metabolism.
    novelty: 30

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the available information, it is unlikely that SDR9C7 is essential in cancer cell lines, as it is not directly involved in critical cellular processes.
