simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: KRT25 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: KRT25 (Keratin 25) is a type I intermediate filament protein, primarily expressed in hair follicles. Its expression in cancer cell lines is variable and depends on the specific type of cancer and the cell line being studied.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: KRT25 involvement in cancer-related pathways
    probability: 20
    explanation: KRT25 is not a well-known player in cancer-related pathways. However, keratins in general have been implicated in various cellular processes, such as cell migration, invasion, and signaling. The involvement of KRT25 in these processes in cancer cell lines is not well-established and requires further investigation.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: KRT25 essentiality in cancer cell survival
    probability: 10
    explanation: Given the limited evidence of KRT25 involvement in cancer-related pathways and its primary expression in hair follicles, it is unlikely that KRT25 plays a crucial role in cancer cell survival. However, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out without further experimental validation.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the limited evidence of KRT25 expression in cancer cell lines, its unclear involvement in cancer-related pathways, and its primary expression in hair follicles, it is unlikely that KRT25 is essential in cancer cell lines.
