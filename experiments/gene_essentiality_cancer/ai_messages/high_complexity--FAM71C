parameters:
  - gene: FAM71C
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: FAM71C (Family with sequence similarity 71 member C) is a protein-coding gene with unknown function [1]. The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project systematically identifies genes that are essential for the survival of cancer cell lines [2].
    entities: FAM71C, DepMap
    assumptions: FAM71C expression may have an impact on cancer cell line survival.
    consequence: potential essentiality of FAM71C in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: Since FAM71C is a protein-coding gene, it may have a role in cancer cell line survival, but its function is currently unknown.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: The DepMap project uses CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi technologies to identify essential genes in cancer cell lines [2]. Essential genes are those whose loss of function leads to reduced cell viability or cell death [3].
    entities: CRISPR-Cas9, RNAi, essential genes, cancer cell lines
    assumptions: If FAM71C is essential in cancer cell lines, it should be identified as such in the DepMap dataset.
    consequence: identification of FAM71C as essential or non-essential in DepMap dataset
    probability: 90
    explanation: The DepMap project is a comprehensive resource for identifying essential genes in cancer cell lines, and it is highly likely that FAM71C's essentiality status can be determined from this dataset.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the assumption that FAM71C's essentiality status can be determined from the DepMap dataset, it is likely that FAM71C is essential in cancer cell lines. However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm this prediction.
