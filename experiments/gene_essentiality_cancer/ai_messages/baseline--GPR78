conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: There is currently no strong evidence in the literature to suggest that GPR78 is essential in cancer cell-lines. However, it is important to note that the role of genes in cancer can be context-dependent and may vary across different types of cancer and cell lines. Further research is needed to determine the potential role of GPR78 in cancer cell-lines.
