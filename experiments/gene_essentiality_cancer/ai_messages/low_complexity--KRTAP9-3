simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: KRTAP9-3 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: KRTAP9-3 is a gene encoding a keratin-associated protein, which is involved in hair formation. To determine if it is essential in cancer cell lines, we first need to examine its expression in these cells.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: low KRTAP9-3 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 90
    explanation: Keratin-associated proteins are primarily expressed in hair follicle cells and are not typically associated with cancer cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that KRTAP9-3 expression is low or absent in cancer cell lines.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: no significant impact on cancer cell survival or proliferation
    probability: 85
    explanation: Given the low expression of KRTAP9-3 in cancer cell lines, it is unlikely that this gene plays a significant role in cancer cell survival or proliferation. Essential genes are typically those that are required for cell survival, growth, or division, and KRTAP9-3 does not appear to be involved in these processes in cancer cells.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the low expression of KRTAP9-3 in cancer cell lines and its primary function in hair formation, it is unlikely that this gene is essential in cancer cell lines.
