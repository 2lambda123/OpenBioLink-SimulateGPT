conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: PRPF19 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, DNA repair, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Its dysregulation has been associated with various cancers, and it has been shown to be essential for the survival of certain cancer cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that PRPF19 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
