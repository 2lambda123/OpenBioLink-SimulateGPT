simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: FAM71C gene expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: To determine if the FAM71C gene is essential in cancer cell lines, we first need to examine its expression in various cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: FAM71C gene function analysis
    probability: 100
    explanation: After confirming the expression of FAM71C in cancer cell lines, we need to analyze its function and role in cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: FAM71C gene knockdown or knockout in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: To determine the essentiality of FAM71C in cancer cell lines, we need to perform gene knockdown or knockout experiments and observe the effects on cell viability, proliferation, and other relevant cellular processes.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: comparison of FAM71C knockdown or knockout effects with control cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: After performing FAM71C knockdown or knockout experiments, we need to compare the results with control cancer cell lines to determine if the loss of FAM71C function significantly affects cancer cell survival and growth.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely or unlikely
  explanation: The final outcome of whether FAM71C is likely essential in cancer cell lines depends on the results of the experiments and comparisons mentioned in the simulation steps. If the loss of FAM71C function leads to significant impairment of cancer cell survival and growth, it is likely essential. If not, it is unlikely essential.
