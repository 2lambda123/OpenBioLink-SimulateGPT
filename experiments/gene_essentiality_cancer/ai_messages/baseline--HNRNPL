conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: The HNRNPL gene encodes for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L, which is involved in pre-mRNA processing, alternative splicing, and mRNA stability. Dysregulation of these processes has been implicated in cancer development and progression. Additionally, several studies have reported the association of HNRNPL with various cancer types, suggesting that it may play a role in cancer cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, it is likely that HNRNPL is essential in cancer cell-lines.
