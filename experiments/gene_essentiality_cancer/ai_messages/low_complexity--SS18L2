simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: SS18L2 gene expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: The SS18L2 gene is present in the human genome and can be expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: SS18L2 protein production
    probability: 90
    explanation: If the SS18L2 gene is expressed in cancer cell lines, it is likely that the corresponding SS18L2 protein will be produced through the process of transcription and translation.

  - step: 3
    level: molecular
    consequence: SS18L2 protein function in cancer cell lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: The SS18L2 protein is a member of the synovial sarcoma translocation gene family and has been implicated in chromatin remodeling. It is likely that the SS18L2 protein will have a functional role in cancer cell lines, potentially contributing to cancer-related processes.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: SS18L2 protein essentiality assessment
    probability: 50
    explanation: To determine if the SS18L2 protein is essential in cancer cell lines, functional studies such as gene knockdown or knockout experiments would need to be performed. The essentiality of a gene can vary depending on the specific cancer cell line and the context in which it is studied.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: While the SS18L2 protein may have a functional role in cancer cell lines, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that it is likely essential across all cancer cell lines. The essentiality of a gene can be context-dependent and may vary between different cancer types and cell lines.
