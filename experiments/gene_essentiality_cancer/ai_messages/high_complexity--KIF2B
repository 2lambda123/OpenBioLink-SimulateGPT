  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: KIF2B (kinesin family member 2B) is a member of the kinesin-13 family, which is involved in microtubule depolymerization and plays a role in mitosis and meiosis [1]. Kinesins are motor proteins that move along microtubules and are involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell division [2]. KIF2B has been reported to be overexpressed in some cancer types, such as breast cancer [3].
    entities: KIF2B, kinesin-13 family, microtubules, mitosis, meiosis, cancer cell-lines
    assumptions: KIF2B is involved in microtubule depolymerization and plays a role in cell division. Its overexpression has been observed in some cancer types.
    consequence: potential role of KIF2B in cancer cell-line proliferation and survival
    probability: 70
    explanation: Given the involvement of KIF2B in cell division and its overexpression in some cancer types, it is plausible that KIF2B may play a role in cancer cell-line proliferation and survival.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Essential genes are those that are required for the survival of an organism or cell [4]. In cancer cell-lines, essential genes are often involved in processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to apoptosis [5]. The dependency of cancer cell-lines on specific genes can be assessed using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens [6].
    entities: essential genes, cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens
    assumptions: Essential genes in cancer cell-lines are involved in processes like cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to apoptosis. KIF2B may play a role in cancer cell-line proliferation and survival.
    consequence: KIF2B may be essential in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 60
    explanation: Since KIF2B is involved in cell division and may play a role in cancer cell-line proliferation and survival, it is possible that KIF2B is essential in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 30

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the involvement of KIF2B in cell division and its potential role in cancer cell-line proliferation and survival, it is likely that KIF2B is essential in cancer cell-lines.
