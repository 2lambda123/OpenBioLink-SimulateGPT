conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: ZP2 (Zona Pellucida Glycoprotein 2) is primarily involved in the formation of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding oocytes in mammals. Its function is related to fertilization and early embryo development, rather than cancer cell growth or survival. Therefore, it is unlikely that ZP2 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
