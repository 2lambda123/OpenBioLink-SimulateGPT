simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: NDUFB3 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: NDUFB3 is a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation. It is expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: impact of NDUFB3 on oxidative phosphorylation
    probability: 100
    explanation: As a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, NDUFB3 plays a role in the electron transport chain, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: cancer cell reliance on oxidative phosphorylation
    probability: 50
    explanation: Cancer cells can rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, but they often exhibit a preference for glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect. The reliance on oxidative phosphorylation can vary among different cancer cell lines and tumor types.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: impact of NDUFB3 inhibition on cancer cell viability
    probability: 50
    explanation: If a cancer cell line relies on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, inhibiting NDUFB3 could impair ATP production and potentially affect cell viability. However, if the cancer cell line relies more on glycolysis, the impact of NDUFB3 inhibition might be less significant.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: While NDUFB3 is involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which can be important for energy production in some cancer cell lines, many cancer cells exhibit a preference for glycolysis. Therefore, it is unlikely that NDUFB3 is essential in all cancer cell lines. The essentiality of NDUFB3 may depend on the specific cancer cell line and its reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.
