parameters:
  - IL17F gene
  - cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: IL17F is a member of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of cytokines, which are involved in immune responses and inflammation [1]. IL17F has been reported to play a role in various inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and psoriasis [2]. However, its role in cancer is not well-established.
    entities: IL17F, cytokines, immune responses, inflammation
    assumptions: IL17F may have a role in cancer cell-lines, but its involvement is not well-understood.
    consequence: potential involvement of IL17F in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: The role of IL17F in cancer is not well-established, but its involvement in immune responses and inflammation suggests that it may have a role in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 50

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Some studies have reported that IL17F can promote tumor growth and angiogenesis in certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer [3]. However, other studies have shown that IL17F can have anti-tumor effects in other cancer types, such as breast cancer [4]. This suggests that the role of IL17F in cancer is context-dependent and may vary between different cancer types.
    entities: IL17F, tumor growth, angiogenesis, colorectal cancer, breast cancer
    assumptions: The role of IL17F in cancer cell-lines may be context-dependent and vary between different cancer types.
    consequence: context-dependent role of IL17F in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 70
    explanation: The conflicting reports on the role of IL17F in different cancer types suggest that its involvement in cancer cell-lines may be context-dependent.
    novelty: 60

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the available evidence, it is unlikely that IL17F is essential in cancer cell-lines, as its role in cancer is not well-established and appears to be context-dependent.
