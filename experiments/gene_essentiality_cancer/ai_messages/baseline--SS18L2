conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: SS18L2 (also known as CREST) is not a well-known essential gene in cancer cell lines. While it has been implicated in some cancer-related processes, such as chromosomal translocations in synovial sarcoma, it is not considered a universally essential gene for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Essential genes in cancer cell lines are typically those involved in fundamental cellular processes, such as DNA replication, cell division, and metabolism.
