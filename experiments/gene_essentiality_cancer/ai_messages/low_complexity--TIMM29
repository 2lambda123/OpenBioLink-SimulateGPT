simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: TIMM29 expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: TIMM29 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the mitochondrial import and insertion of tail-anchored proteins. To determine if it is essential in cancer cell lines, we first need to examine its expression in these cells.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: TIMM29 function in cancer cell lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: If TIMM29 is expressed in cancer cell lines, it is likely to have a functional role. The protein it encodes is involved in mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and survival. Disruption of mitochondrial function can lead to cell death, so it is possible that TIMM29 plays a role in cancer cell survival.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: cancer cell dependency on TIMM29
    probability: 60
    explanation: If TIMM29 has a functional role in cancer cell lines, the next step is to determine if these cells are dependent on TIMM29 for survival. This can be assessed by knocking down or inhibiting TIMM29 expression and observing the effects on cancer cell viability.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: TIMM29 essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 50
    explanation: If cancer cells are dependent on TIMM29 for survival, then it can be considered essential in these cell lines. However, the essentiality of a gene can vary between different cancer types and individual cell lines. Therefore, the probability of TIMM29 being essential in all cancer cell lines is uncertain.

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: While TIMM29 may have a functional role in cancer cell lines and could be essential for some, it is unlikely to be essential in all cancer cell lines due to the variability in gene essentiality across different cancer types and individual cell lines.
