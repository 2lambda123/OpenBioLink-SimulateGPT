simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: POLR3H expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: POLR3H is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs and 5S rRNA. It is expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: RNA polymerase III activity in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: Since POLR3H is a subunit of RNA polymerase III, its expression in cancer cell lines contributes to the overall activity of RNA polymerase III, which is responsible for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: small non-coding RNA synthesis in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: The activity of RNA polymerase III, which includes the POLR3H subunit, leads to the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs in cancer cell lines. These small non-coding RNAs play essential roles in various cellular processes, such as translation and ribosome biogenesis.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: essential cellular processes in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: The small non-coding RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase III, including the POLR3H subunit, are involved in essential cellular processes in cancer cell lines. Disruption of these processes could lead to impaired cell growth and proliferation.

  - step: 5
    level: cellular
    consequence: POLR3H knockdown effects on cancer cell lines
    probability: 75
    explanation: Studies have shown that knockdown of POLR3H can lead to reduced cell growth and proliferation in some cancer cell lines. However, the essentiality of POLR3H may vary depending on the specific cancer cell line and its genetic background.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the role of POLR3H in RNA polymerase III activity and the synthesis of small non-coding RNAs involved in essential cellular processes, it is likely that POLR3H is essential in cancer cell lines. However, the essentiality may vary depending on the specific cancer cell line and its genetic background.
