conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: KRT25 (Keratin 25) is a type II cytokeratin, primarily expressed in hair follicles and associated with hair structure. It is not commonly associated with cancer cell lines or tumorigenesis. Essential genes in cancer cell lines are typically involved in cell proliferation, survival, and other critical cellular processes. Therefore, it is unlikely that KRT25 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
