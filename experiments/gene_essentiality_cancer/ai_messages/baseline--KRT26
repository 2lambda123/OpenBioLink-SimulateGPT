conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: KRT26 (Keratin 26) is a type II keratin gene, primarily expressed in hair follicles and not typically associated with cancer cell lines. Essential genes in cancer cell lines are usually involved in cell proliferation, survival, and other critical cellular processes. Therefore, it is unlikely that KRT26 is essential in cancer cell lines.
