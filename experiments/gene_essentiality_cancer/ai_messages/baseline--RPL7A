conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: RPL7A is a ribosomal protein gene, which is involved in protein synthesis. Many ribosomal protein genes have been found to be essential in cancer cell lines due to their role in maintaining high levels of protein synthesis required for rapid cell proliferation. Additionally, some studies have reported the association of RPL7A with cancer progression and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is likely that RPL7A is essential in cancer cell lines.
