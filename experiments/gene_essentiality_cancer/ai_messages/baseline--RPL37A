conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: The RPL37A gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit. Ribosomal proteins are essential for protein synthesis, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation. Cancer cells typically have increased rates of protein synthesis to support their rapid growth and division. Therefore, it is likely that the RPL37A gene is essential in cancer cell-lines, as it plays a critical role in the protein synthesis machinery.
