parameters:
  - gene: OR52W1
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: OR52W1 is an olfactory receptor gene, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family [1]. Olfactory receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules in the olfactory system [2]. Some olfactory receptors have been reported to be expressed in non-olfactory tissues and have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer [3].
    entities: OR52W1, GPCR, olfactory receptors
    assumptions: OR52W1 expression may be present in cancer cell-lines.
    consequence: potential involvement of OR52W1 in cancer cell-line processes
    probability: 50
    explanation: The expression of OR52W1 in cancer cell-lines is uncertain, and its potential involvement in cancer cell-line processes is based on the known functions of olfactory receptors in non-olfactory tissues.
    novelty: 50

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: The essentiality of a gene in cancer cell-lines is typically determined by its role in cell survival, proliferation, or other critical cellular processes [4]. There is limited evidence linking OR52W1 to such processes in cancer cell-lines.
    entities: OR52W1, cancer cell-lines, cell survival, cell proliferation
    assumptions: OR52W1 may have a role in cancer cell-line survival or proliferation.
    consequence: OR52W1 is unlikely essential in cancer cell-lines
    probability: 80
    explanation: The lack of evidence linking OR52W1 to critical cellular processes in cancer cell-lines suggests that it is unlikely to be essential for their survival or proliferation.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the limited evidence linking OR52W1 to critical cellular processes in cancer cell-lines, it is unlikely that OR52W1 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
