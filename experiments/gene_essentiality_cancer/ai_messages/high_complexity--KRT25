parameters:
  - gene: KRT25
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: KRT25 (Keratin 25) is a type II keratin protein that is part of the keratin family, which is involved in the structural integrity of epithelial cells and tissues [1]. Keratins are not typically associated with essential cellular processes in cancer cells, but rather with the differentiation and maintenance of epithelial tissues [2]. There is limited evidence linking KRT25 to cancer cell survival or proliferation.
    entities: KRT25, keratin family, epithelial cells, cancer cells
    assumptions: KRT25 is not directly involved in essential cellular processes in cancer cells.
    consequence: KRT25 is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the known functions of KRT25 and its limited association with cancer cell survival or proliferation, it is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the known functions of KRT25 and its limited association with cancer cell survival or proliferation, it is unlikely that KRT25 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
