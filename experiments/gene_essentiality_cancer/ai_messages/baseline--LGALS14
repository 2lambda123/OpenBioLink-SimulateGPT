conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: The gene LGALS14 is not well-known for its involvement in cancer cell lines. While galectins, a family of proteins to which LGALS14 belongs, have been implicated in various cancer-related processes, there is limited evidence specifically linking LGALS14 to cancer cell lines. Therefore, it is unlikely that LGALS14 is essential in cancer cell-lines.
