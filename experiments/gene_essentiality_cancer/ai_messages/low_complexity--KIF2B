simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: KIF2B expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: KIF2B is a kinesin family member protein involved in microtubule dynamics. Its expression in cancer cell lines is necessary to determine its potential role in cancer cell survival and proliferation.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: KIF2B regulates microtubule dynamics
    probability: 100
    explanation: KIF2B is a microtubule depolymerase that plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and cell migration.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: KIF2B involvement in mitosis
    probability: 90
    explanation: Given its role in microtubule dynamics, KIF2B is likely involved in mitosis, specifically in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Abnormalities in these processes can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: KIF2B essentiality in cancer cell lines
    probability: 60
    explanation: If KIF2B plays a critical role in mitosis and genomic stability in cancer cell lines, it may be essential for their survival and proliferation. However, the essentiality of KIF2B in cancer cell lines may vary depending on the specific type of cancer and the presence of other molecular factors.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Based on the simulation, KIF2B is likely essential in cancer cell lines due to its involvement in microtubule dynamics, mitosis, and genomic stability. However, the essentiality of KIF2B may vary depending on the specific cancer type and other molecular factors.
