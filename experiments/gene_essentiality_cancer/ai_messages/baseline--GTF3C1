conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: GTF3C1 is a general transcription factor involved in RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription. While it plays a role in transcription, it is not specifically associated with cancer cell survival or proliferation. Therefore, it is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
