parameters:
  - gene: KRT26
  - context: cancer cell-lines

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: KRT26 (Keratin 26) is a type II keratin protein, which is part of the intermediate filament family of proteins. These proteins are involved in the structural integrity of cells and tissues, particularly in epithelial cells [1]. KRT26 is expressed in the hair follicle and has been associated with hair growth [2]. There is limited evidence linking KRT26 to cancer.
    entities: KRT26, keratin proteins, intermediate filaments, epithelial cells, hair follicle
    assumptions: KRT26 has a similar function to other keratin proteins and is involved in the structural integrity of cells and tissues. Its primary expression is in the hair follicle, and it may not have a significant role in cancer cell-lines.
    consequence: KRT26 is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
    probability: 80
    explanation: Given the limited evidence linking KRT26 to cancer and its primary expression in the hair follicle, it is unlikely that KRT26 plays a significant role in cancer cell-lines.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: Based on the known functions and expression patterns of KRT26, it is unlikely to be essential in cancer cell-lines.
