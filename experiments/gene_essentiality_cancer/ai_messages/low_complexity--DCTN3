simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    consequence: DCTN3 gene expression in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: The DCTN3 gene is expressed in various cell types, including cancer cell lines. Its expression is necessary to determine its potential essentiality in cancer cell lines.

  - step: 2
    level: molecular
    consequence: DCTN3 protein production
    probability: 100
    explanation: The DCTN3 gene encodes for the DCTN3 protein, which is a subunit of the dynactin complex. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell division.

  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: DCTN3 protein function in cancer cell lines
    probability: 100
    explanation: The DCTN3 protein, as part of the dynactin complex, plays a role in intracellular transport and cell division. These processes are essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation.

  - step: 4
    level: cellular
    consequence: DCTN3 gene essentiality assessment
    probability: 75
    explanation: To determine the essentiality of the DCTN3 gene in cancer cell lines, gene knockout or knockdown experiments can be performed. If the loss of DCTN3 function leads to a significant decrease in cancer cell survival or proliferation, it can be considered essential.

conclusion:
  outcome: likely
  explanation: Given the involvement of the DCTN3 protein in essential cellular processes such as intracellular transport and cell division, it is likely that the DCTN3 gene is essential in cancer cell lines. However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
