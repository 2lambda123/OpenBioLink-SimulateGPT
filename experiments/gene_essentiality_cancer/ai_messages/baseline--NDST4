conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: NDST4 (N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 4) is not a well-known cancer-related gene, and there is limited evidence to suggest that it plays a significant role in cancer cell lines. While it may have some involvement in certain cellular processes, it is unlikely to be essential for cancer cell survival or proliferation.
