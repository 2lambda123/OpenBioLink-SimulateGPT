conclusion:
  outcome: unlikely
  explanation: POLR3H encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III, which is involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs. While it plays a role in cellular processes, there is limited evidence to suggest that POLR3H is essential in cancer cell-lines. Most cancer-related studies focus on other genes with more direct roles in cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis.
