conclusion:
  outcome: Enhanced innate immune response
  explanation: Beta-glucan is a known immunomodulator that can prime the immune system, particularly the innate immune response. Upon rechallenge with high-dose LPS after 90 days, the mouse is likely to exhibit an enhanced innate immune response due to the previous exposure to beta-glucan. This response may include increased phagocytosis, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.
