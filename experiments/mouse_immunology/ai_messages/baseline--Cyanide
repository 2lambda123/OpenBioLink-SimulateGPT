conclusion:
  outcome: Death
  explanation: Cyanide is a potent toxin that inhibits cellular respiration by binding to cytochrome c oxidase, a key enzyme in the electron transport chain. This prevents cells from producing ATP, leading to a rapid depletion of energy and ultimately causing death in the organism.
