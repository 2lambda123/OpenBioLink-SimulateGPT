conclusion:
  outcome: Broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring of immune response
  explanation: The patient has sepsis, which is typically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to target the underlying infection. Fluid resuscitation is also important to maintain blood pressure and organ perfusion. High ferritin levels indicate an inflammatory response, and a high percentage of CD45/CD14-monocytes expressing HLA-DR suggests an active immune response. Monitoring the patient's immune response and adjusting treatment as needed is crucial for optimal recovery.
