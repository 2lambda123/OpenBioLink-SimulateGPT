Below are 4 examples of patients with clinical characterization and their associated progression-free survivals:

Example 1: A {EXAMPLE1_AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS:.0f} year old patient was diagnosed with stage {EXAMPLE1_STAGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS} {EXAMPLE1_CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED}{EXAMPLE1_PRIMARY_SITE}. His/her tumor exhibited {EXAMPLE1_PATIENT_GRADE} differentiation histology, had metastasized and showed {EXAMPLE1_CARCINOMATOSIS}signs of carcinomatosis.
The patient had {EXAMPLE1_PFS_MONTHS:.0f} months of progression-free survival.


Example 2: A {EXAMPLE2_AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS:.0f} year old patient was diagnosed with stage {EXAMPLE2_STAGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS} {EXAMPLE2_CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED}{EXAMPLE2_PRIMARY_SITE}. His/her tumor exhibited {EXAMPLE2_PATIENT_GRADE} differentiation histology, had metastasized and showed {EXAMPLE2_CARCINOMATOSIS}signs of carcinomatosis.
The patient had {EXAMPLE2_PFS_MONTHS:.0f} months of progression-free survival.


Example 3: A {EXAMPLE3_AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS:.0f} year old patient was diagnosed with stage {EXAMPLE3_STAGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS} {EXAMPLE3_CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED}{EXAMPLE3_PRIMARY_SITE}. His/her tumor exhibited {EXAMPLE3_PATIENT_GRADE} differentiation histology, had metastasized and showed {EXAMPLE3_CARCINOMATOSIS}signs of carcinomatosis.
The patient had {EXAMPLE3_PFS_MONTHS:.0f} months of progression-free survival.


Example 4: A {EXAMPLE4_AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS:.0f} year old patient was diagnosed with stage {EXAMPLE4_STAGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS} {EXAMPLE4_CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED}{EXAMPLE4_PRIMARY_SITE}. His/her tumor exhibited {EXAMPLE4_PATIENT_GRADE} differentiation histology, had metastasized and showed {EXAMPLE4_CARCINOMATOSIS}signs of carcinomatosis.
The patient had {EXAMPLE4_PFS_MONTHS:.0f} months of progression-free survival.

Now I need your help with the following case. Use the examples above to calibrate your answer and focus on novelty, if possible.

Consider a {AGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS:.0f} year old patient who is diagnosed with stage {STAGE_AT_DIAGNOSIS} {CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED}{PRIMARY_SITE}. The tumor exhibits {PATIENT_GRADE} differentiation histology, has metastasized and shows {CARCINOMATOSIS}signs of carcinomatosis.

Given the general effectiveness of {CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED} therapies, explore how the disease progresses under an optimal standard of care treatment plan, focusing on the molecular and higher-level processes impacting tumor progression. As the final outcome, report the expected progression-free survival in months.
