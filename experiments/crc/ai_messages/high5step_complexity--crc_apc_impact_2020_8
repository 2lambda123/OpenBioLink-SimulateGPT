parameters:
  - age: 57
  - cancer_stage: III
  - cancer_location: right side of the colon
  - differentiation: poorly differentiated
  - metastasis: yes
  - carcinomatosis: no
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: The Wnt signaling pathway is often dysregulated in colon adenocarcinoma, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth [1]. Poorly differentiated tumors are associated with a higher degree of genetic instability and a more aggressive phenotype [2].
    entities: Wnt signaling pathway, cell proliferation, tumor growth, genetic instability
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has dysregulated Wnt signaling and increased genetic instability due to its poorly differentiated status.
    consequence: increased tumor growth and metastatic potential
    probability: 80
    explanation: Dysregulated Wnt signaling and genetic instability are common features of poorly differentiated colon adenocarcinomas, which can lead to increased tumor growth and metastatic potential [1,2].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in colon adenocarcinoma [3]. Poorly differentiated tumors may have a higher infiltration of TAMs [4].
    entities: tumor-associated macrophages, angiogenesis, metastasis
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has a higher infiltration of TAMs due to its poorly differentiated status.
    consequence: increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis
    probability: 70
    explanation: TAM infiltration can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, which may be more pronounced in poorly differentiated tumors [3,4].
    novelty: 20

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Optimal standard of care for stage III colon adenocarcinoma typically includes surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy [5]. Chemotherapy can target rapidly dividing cancer cells and reduce tumor growth [6].
    entities: surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, cancer cells, tumor growth
    assumptions: The patient undergoes surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy as part of their optimal standard of care treatment plan.
    consequence: reduced tumor growth and metastasis
    probability: 90
    explanation: Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in stage III colon adenocarcinoma patients [5,6].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 4
    level: organ
    facts: The right side of the colon has a distinct molecular profile compared to the left side, which may influence treatment response and prognosis [7]. Right-sided tumors are generally associated with worse outcomes [8].
    entities: right-sided colon, molecular profile, treatment response, prognosis
    assumptions: The patient's right-sided colon adenocarcinoma may have a distinct molecular profile that influences treatment response and prognosis.
    consequence: potentially worse treatment response and prognosis
    probability: 60
    explanation: Right-sided colon adenocarcinomas have distinct molecular profiles and are generally associated with worse outcomes compared to left-sided tumors [7,8].
    novelty: 10

  - step: 5
    level: organism
    facts: Age is a prognostic factor in colon cancer, with older patients generally having worse outcomes [9]. The patient's age (57) is relatively younger compared to the example cases.
    entities: age, prognosis
    assumptions: The patient's relatively younger age may have a positive impact on their prognosis.
    consequence: better prognosis compared to older patients
    probability: 60
    explanation: Younger patients with colon cancer generally have better outcomes compared to older patients [9].
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: 10 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Considering the patient's poorly differentiated tumor, right-sided colon location, and optimal standard of care treatment, as well as their relatively younger age, we estimate a progression-free survival of 10 months. This is based on the molecular and higher-level processes impacting tumor progression and the calibration from the provided examples.
