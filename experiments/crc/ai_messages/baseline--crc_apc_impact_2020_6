conclusion:
  outcome: 8 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples, patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma and moderately differentiated differentiation histology tend to have a progression-free survival between 7 and 9 months. The patient in question has a similar profile to Example 3, but with no signs of carcinomatosis, which is a favorable factor. Considering the patient's age (71 years old) and the location of the tumor (right side of the colon), the expected progression-free survival under an optimal standard of care treatment plan is estimated to be around 8 months. This takes into account the general effectiveness of colon adenocarcinoma therapies and the molecular and higher-level processes impacting tumor progression.
