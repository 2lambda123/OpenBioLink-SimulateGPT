simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: organism
    consequence: stage IV colon adenocarcinoma diagnosis
    probability: 100
    explanation: The patient is diagnosed with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma on the left side of the colon, with poorly differentiated differentiation histology, metastasis, and signs of carcinomatosis.
  - step: 2
    level: organ
    consequence: initiation of optimal standard of care treatment
    probability: 100
    explanation: Given the diagnosis, the patient will receive an optimal standard of care treatment plan, which typically includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.
  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: reduction in tumor size and metastatic spread
    probability: 80
    explanation: The optimal standard of care treatment plan is designed to target and kill cancer cells, reducing the size of the primary tumor and limiting the spread of metastatic cells.
  - step: 4
    level: molecular
    consequence: development of treatment resistance
    probability: 70
    explanation: Due to the poorly differentiated histology and presence of carcinomatosis, there is a higher likelihood that some cancer cells will develop resistance to the treatment, leading to disease progression.
  - step: 5
    level: cellular
    consequence: tumor regrowth and metastatic spread
    probability: 60
    explanation: As treatment-resistant cancer cells survive and proliferate, the tumor may regrow, and metastatic spread may continue, leading to disease progression.
  - step: 6
    level: organ
    consequence: disease progression despite treatment
    probability: 50
    explanation: The combination of poorly differentiated histology, metastasis, and carcinomatosis increases the likelihood of disease progression despite the optimal standard of care treatment plan.

conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples and the patient's clinical characteristics, the expected progression-free survival for this patient under an optimal standard of care treatment plan is approximately 6 months. This estimate takes into account the stage IV diagnosis, poorly differentiated histology, metastasis, and presence of carcinomatosis, which are factors associated with a more aggressive disease course and shorter progression-free survival.
