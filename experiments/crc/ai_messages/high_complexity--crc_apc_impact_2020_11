parameters:
  - age: 57
  - cancer_stage: IV
  - cancer_type: colon adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: left side of the colon
  - tumor_differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: present
  - carcinomatosis: present
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: Standard of care treatment for stage IV colon adenocarcinoma typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [1]. Chemotherapy drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, target rapidly dividing cancer cells [2]. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, inhibit specific molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and progression [3]. Immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells [4].
    entities: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, cancer cells, immune system
    assumptions: The patient receives optimal standard of care treatment, which includes a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
    consequence: Decreased tumor growth and progression due to the effects of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
    probability: 80
    explanation: The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy is expected to effectively target and reduce tumor growth and progression in most patients with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor heterogeneity and the presence of cancer stem cells can contribute to treatment resistance and disease progression [5]. Moderately differentiated tumors may have a mix of well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cells, which can impact treatment response [6].
    entities: tumor heterogeneity, cancer stem cells, treatment resistance, disease progression, tumor differentiation
    assumptions: The patient's tumor exhibits moderately differentiated histology, which may include a mix of well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cells.
    consequence: Potential development of treatment resistance due to tumor heterogeneity and the presence of cancer stem cells.
    probability: 60
    explanation: Tumor heterogeneity and the presence of cancer stem cells can lead to treatment resistance, which may impact the effectiveness of the standard of care treatment in controlling tumor progression.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Metastasis and carcinomatosis indicate advanced disease and can negatively impact treatment outcomes [7]. Carcinomatosis, the presence of multiple small metastases throughout the peritoneal cavity, can further complicate treatment and contribute to poorer prognosis [8].
    entities: metastasis, carcinomatosis, treatment outcomes, prognosis
    assumptions: The patient's cancer has metastasized and shows signs of carcinomatosis, indicating advanced disease.
    consequence: Reduced treatment effectiveness and increased risk of disease progression due to metastasis and carcinomatosis.
    probability: 70
    explanation: The presence of metastasis and carcinomatosis can negatively impact treatment outcomes and contribute to a higher risk of disease progression.
    novelty: 10

conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Given the patient's stage IV colon adenocarcinoma with moderately differentiated histology, metastasis, and carcinomatosis, and considering the effectiveness of the optimal standard of care treatment, the expected progression-free survival is estimated to be around 6 months. This estimate takes into account the potential development of treatment resistance due to tumor heterogeneity and the negative impact of metastasis and carcinomatosis on treatment outcomes.
