simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: organism
    consequence: initiation of standard of care treatment
    probability: 100
    explanation: The 60-year-old patient with stage IV colon adenocarcinoma on the right side of the colon, poorly differentiated differentiation histology, metastasis, and signs of carcinomatosis will receive an optimal standard of care treatment plan, which typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy.
  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    consequence: tumor cell death
    probability: 80
    explanation: The standard of care treatment plan aims to target and kill cancer cells, leading to tumor cell death. However, the effectiveness of the treatment may vary depending on the tumor's characteristics, such as its poorly differentiated histology and the presence of metastasis and carcinomatosis.
  - step: 3
    level: cellular
    consequence: development of treatment resistance
    probability: 60
    explanation: Due to the poorly differentiated histology and the presence of metastasis and carcinomatosis, there is a higher likelihood that some cancer cells will develop resistance to the standard of care treatment, allowing them to survive and continue to proliferate.
  - step: 4
    level: tissue
    consequence: tumor growth and metastasis
    probability: 50
    explanation: As some cancer cells develop resistance to treatment, they may continue to grow and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further tumor growth and metastasis.
  - step: 5
    level: organism
    consequence: disease progression
    probability: 40
    explanation: Despite the standard of care treatment, the patient's disease may continue to progress due to the development of treatment resistance, tumor growth, and metastasis.

conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples and the patient's clinical characteristics, including stage IV colon adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated histology, metastasis, and carcinomatosis, the expected progression-free survival under an optimal standard of care treatment plan is estimated to be around 6 months. This estimation takes into account the general effectiveness of colon adenocarcinoma therapies and the patient's specific disease characteristics.
