conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months
  explanation: Based on the provided examples, patients with stage IV cancer and poorly differentiated histology tend to have shorter progression-free survival times. In Example 1, the patient with stage IV rectal adenocarcinoma had a progression-free survival of 2 months. Although the current case involves colon adenocarcinoma, both are gastrointestinal cancers and share similarities in treatment and prognosis. The presence of carcinomatosis, as seen in Example 3, also contributes to a worse prognosis. Considering the patient's younger age and the general effectiveness of colon adenocarcinoma therapies, a slightly better outcome than Example 1 can be expected. Therefore, the estimated progression-free survival for this patient under an optimal standard of care treatment plan is 6 months.
