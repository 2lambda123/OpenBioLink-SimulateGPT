conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples, patients with stage IV rectal adenocarcinoma (Example 1) tend to have shorter progression-free survival compared to those with stage III colon adenocarcinoma (Examples 2, 3, and 4). The patient in question has a moderately differentiated tumor, which is associated with better outcomes than poorly differentiated tumors (Examples 1 and 2). Additionally, the absence of carcinomatosis is a favorable factor (Examples 1, 2, and 4). Considering these factors and the effectiveness of rectal adenocarcinoma therapies, the patient is expected to have a progression-free survival of approximately 6 months under an optimal standard of care treatment plan.
