conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: The patient has stage IV colon adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated histology and metastasis, but no signs of carcinomatosis. Comparing this case to the provided examples, the patient's condition is more severe than Example 2 (stage III, poorly differentiated, 14 months PFS) but less severe than Example 1 (stage IV, poorly differentiated, rectal adenocarcinoma, 2 months PFS). Considering the general effectiveness of colon adenocarcinoma therapies and the patient's younger age, an optimal standard of care treatment plan may provide a slightly better outcome than the average of Examples 1 and 2. Therefore, the expected progression-free survival is estimated to be around 6 months.
