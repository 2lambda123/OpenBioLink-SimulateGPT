parameters:
  - age: 62
  - cancer_stage: III
  - cancer_type: rectal adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: rectum
  - differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: yes
  - carcinomatosis: no
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: The optimal standard of care for stage III rectal adenocarcinoma typically includes neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy[1]. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy aims to shrink the tumor and kill cancer cells, while adjuvant chemotherapy targets any remaining cancer cells after surgery[2].
    entities: chemoradiotherapy, surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy
    assumptions: The patient receives the optimal standard of care treatment plan.
    consequence: tumor shrinkage and reduced metastasis
    probability: 80
    explanation: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is effective in shrinking the tumor and reducing metastasis in most cases[1].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor shrinkage and reduced metastasis can lead to a decrease in the number of cancer cells and a reduction in the likelihood of further metastasis[3].
    entities: cancer cells, metastasis
    assumptions: The patient's tumor responds well to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
    consequence: decreased cancer cell count and reduced metastatic potential
    probability: 75
    explanation: The effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in reducing cancer cell count and metastatic potential is well-established[3].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery is performed to remove the primary tumor and any affected lymph nodes[1]. This further reduces the number of cancer cells and the likelihood of metastasis.
    entities: surgery, primary tumor, lymph nodes
    assumptions: The patient undergoes successful surgery.
    consequence: removal of primary tumor and affected lymph nodes
    probability: 90
    explanation: Surgery is a standard and effective treatment for removing primary tumors and affected lymph nodes in stage III rectal adenocarcinoma[1].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 4
    level: organism
    facts: Adjuvant chemotherapy is administered after surgery to target any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence[2].
    entities: adjuvant chemotherapy, cancer cells, recurrence
    assumptions: The patient receives adjuvant chemotherapy as part of the optimal standard of care treatment plan.
    consequence: reduced risk of cancer recurrence
    probability: 70
    explanation: Adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in reducing the risk of cancer recurrence in many cases[2].
    novelty: 0

  - step: 5
    level: organism
    facts: Progression-free survival is influenced by factors such as age, cancer stage, differentiation, metastasis, and treatment effectiveness[4]. In the provided examples, progression-free survival ranged from 2 to 14 months.
    entities: progression-free survival, age, cancer stage, differentiation, metastasis, treatment effectiveness
    assumptions: The patient's disease progression is influenced by the factors mentioned above.
    consequence: estimation of progression-free survival
    probability: 70
    explanation: Based on the provided examples and the patient's characteristics, an estimation of progression-free survival can be made.
    novelty: 50

conclusion:
  outcome: 10 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Considering the patient's age, cancer stage, differentiation, metastasis, and the effectiveness of the optimal standard of care treatment plan, the expected progression-free survival is estimated to be around 10 months. This estimation is based on the provided examples and the assumption that the patient responds well to the treatment plan.
