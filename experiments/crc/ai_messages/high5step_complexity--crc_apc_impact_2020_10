parameters:
  - age: 56
  - cancer_stage: IV
  - cancer_type: colon adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: left side of the colon
  - tumor_differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: present
  - carcinomatosis: absent
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is often dysregulated in colon adenocarcinoma, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival [1]. Moderately differentiated tumors have intermediate levels of differentiation and are associated with intermediate prognosis [2].
    entities: RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, cell proliferation, cell survival
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has dysregulated RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling, contributing to tumor progression.
    consequence: increased cell proliferation and survival in the tumor
    probability: 80
    explanation: Dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is common in colon adenocarcinoma and contributes to tumor growth.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [3]. In colon adenocarcinoma, TAMs are often associated with poor prognosis [4].
    entities: tumor-associated macrophages, tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has TAMs that contribute to tumor progression.
    consequence: increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis
    probability: 70
    explanation: TAMs are known to promote tumor progression in colon adenocarcinoma.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in tumor progression and response to therapy [5]. In colon adenocarcinoma, the TME can promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis [6].
    entities: tumor microenvironment, tumor growth, invasion, metastasis
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has a TME that contributes to tumor progression.
    consequence: increased tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis
    probability: 75
    explanation: The TME is known to play a significant role in colon adenocarcinoma progression.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 4
    level: organ
    facts: Stage IV colon adenocarcinoma indicates that the cancer has metastasized to distant organs [7]. The liver is a common site of metastasis in colon cancer [8].
    entities: stage IV, metastasis, liver
    assumptions: The patient's cancer has metastasized to the liver.
    consequence: impaired liver function and increased tumor burden
    probability: 70
    explanation: Liver metastasis is common in stage IV colon adenocarcinoma and can impair liver function.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 5
    level: organism
    facts: Optimal standard of care for stage IV colon adenocarcinoma typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy [9]. Treatment response varies among patients, but the goal is to control tumor growth and improve survival.
    entities: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, tumor growth, survival
    assumptions: The patient receives optimal standard of care treatment, which may control tumor growth and improve survival.
    consequence: slowed tumor progression and increased progression-free survival
    probability: 60
    explanation: Optimal standard of care treatment can help control tumor growth and improve survival in stage IV colon adenocarcinoma patients.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: 8 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples and the patient's characteristics, the expected progression-free survival under optimal standard of care treatment is estimated to be 8 months. This estimate takes into account the patient's age, cancer stage, tumor differentiation, metastasis, and absence of carcinomatosis.
