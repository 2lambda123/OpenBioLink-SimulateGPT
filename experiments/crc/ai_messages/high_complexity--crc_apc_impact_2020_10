parameters:
  - age: 56
  - cancer_stage: IV
  - cancer_type: colon adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: left side of the colon
  - tumor_differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: present
  - carcinomatosis: absent
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: Standard of care treatment for stage IV colon adenocarcinoma typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [1]. Chemotherapy drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, target rapidly dividing cancer cells [2]. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, inhibit specific molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and progression [3]. Immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells [4].
    entities: 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, cetuximab, pembrolizumab
    assumptions: The patient receives optimal standard of care treatment, which includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
    consequence: Decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased cancer cell death.
    probability: 80
    explanation: The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy is expected to effectively target cancer cells, reducing their proliferation and promoting cell death.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression and response to therapy [5]. Inflammatory cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), can promote tumor growth and metastasis [6]. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can contribute to therapy resistance [7].
    entities: tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts
    assumptions: The patient's tumor microenvironment contains inflammatory cells and fibroblasts that may influence treatment response.
    consequence: Partial resistance to therapy and potential for residual tumor growth.
    probability: 60
    explanation: The presence of TAMs and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment may contribute to therapy resistance and residual tumor growth, despite optimal standard of care treatment.
    novelty: 50

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Metastasis is a major factor contributing to cancer-related deaths [8]. In colon adenocarcinoma, common sites of metastasis include the liver, lungs, and peritoneum [9]. The presence of metastasis in stage IV colon adenocarcinoma indicates a more aggressive disease and may impact treatment response.
    entities: liver metastasis, lung metastasis, peritoneal metastasis
    assumptions: The patient has metastatic disease, which may affect treatment response and progression-free survival.
    consequence: Reduced treatment effectiveness and shorter progression-free survival.
    probability: 70
    explanation: The presence of metastasis in stage IV colon adenocarcinoma may reduce the effectiveness of treatment and result in a shorter progression-free survival.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: 6 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the patient's age, stage IV colon adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated tumor, metastasis, and absence of carcinomatosis, as well as the effectiveness of optimal standard of care treatment, the patient is expected to have a progression-free survival of approximately 6 months. This estimate takes into account the potential impact of the tumor microenvironment and metastasis on treatment response.
