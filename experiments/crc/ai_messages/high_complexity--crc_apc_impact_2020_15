parameters:
  - age: 60
  - cancer_stage: IV
  - cancer_type: colon adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: right side of the colon
  - tumor_differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: yes
  - carcinomatosis: no
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: Standard of care treatment for stage IV colon adenocarcinoma typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [1]. Chemotherapy drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, target rapidly dividing cancer cells [2]. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, inhibit specific molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and progression [3]. Immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells [4].
    entities: 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, cetuximab, pembrolizumab
    assumptions: The patient receives optimal standard of care treatment, which includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
    consequence: Decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased cancer cell death.
    probability: 80
    explanation: The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy is expected to effectively target cancer cells, reducing their proliferation and increasing cell death.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression and response to therapy [5]. Inflammatory cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), can promote tumor growth and metastasis [6]. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can contribute to therapy resistance [7].
    entities: tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts
    assumptions: The patient's tumor microenvironment contains inflammatory cells and fibroblasts that may influence treatment response.
    consequence: Partial resistance to therapy and potential for residual tumor growth.
    probability: 60
    explanation: The presence of TAMs and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment may contribute to therapy resistance and residual tumor growth.
    novelty: 50

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Metastasis is a major factor contributing to cancer-related deaths [8]. In colon adenocarcinoma, common sites of metastasis include the liver, lungs, and peritoneum [9]. The patient's cancer has already metastasized, increasing the complexity of treatment and the likelihood of disease progression.
    entities: liver metastasis, lung metastasis, peritoneal metastasis
    assumptions: The patient's metastatic disease is being managed with the optimal standard of care treatment.
    consequence: Slower disease progression due to treatment, but potential for further metastasis.
    probability: 70
    explanation: Although the treatment may slow down disease progression, the presence of metastasis increases the risk of further metastatic spread and disease progression.
    novelty: 20

conclusion:
  outcome: 8 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples and the patient's characteristics, including age, cancer stage, tumor differentiation, and metastasis, the expected progression-free survival under optimal standard of care treatment is estimated to be 8 months. This takes into account the effectiveness of the treatment in reducing tumor growth and the potential for therapy resistance and further metastasis.
