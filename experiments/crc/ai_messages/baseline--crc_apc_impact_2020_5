conclusion:
  outcome: 8 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Based on the provided examples, patients with stage III colon adenocarcinoma and moderately differentiated differentiation histology tend to have progression-free survival between 7 and 9 months (Examples 3 and 4). The patient in question has a similar profile to Example 4, with the only difference being the tumor location (rectum vs. left side of the colon). Considering the general effectiveness of colon adenocarcinoma therapies and the absence of carcinomatosis, an optimal standard of care treatment plan would likely result in a progression-free survival of approximately 8 months for this patient.
