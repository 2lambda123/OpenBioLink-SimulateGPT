parameters:
  - age: 50
  - cancer_stage: IV
  - cancer_type: colon adenocarcinoma
  - tumor_location: left side of the colon
  - differentiation: poorly differentiated
  - metastasis: present
  - carcinomatosis: present
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: Standard of care treatment for stage IV colon adenocarcinoma typically includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [1]. Chemotherapy drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, target rapidly dividing cancer cells [2]. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, inhibit specific molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and progression [3]. Immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells [4].
    entities: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, cetuximab, pembrolizumab
    assumptions: The patient receives optimal standard of care treatment, which includes a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
    consequence: Decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased cancer cell death.
    probability: 80
    explanation: The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy is expected to effectively target cancer cells, leading to decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased cancer cell death.
    novelty: 0

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Poorly differentiated tumors are generally more aggressive and less responsive to treatment than moderately differentiated tumors [5]. Carcinomatosis indicates the presence of cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity, which can lead to complications and poorer prognosis [6].
    entities: poorly differentiated tumor, carcinomatosis
    assumptions: The patient's tumor is poorly differentiated and shows signs of carcinomatosis, which may negatively impact treatment response.
    consequence: Reduced treatment effectiveness and increased tumor progression.
    probability: 70
    explanation: The poorly differentiated tumor and presence of carcinomatosis may reduce the effectiveness of the standard of care treatment, leading to increased tumor progression.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 3
    level: organ
    facts: Metastasis is a major factor contributing to cancer-related deaths and is associated with a poorer prognosis [7]. Stage IV colon adenocarcinoma indicates that the cancer has spread to distant organs, such as the liver or lungs [8].
    entities: metastasis, stage IV colon adenocarcinoma
    assumptions: The patient's cancer has metastasized, which may further reduce treatment effectiveness and increase tumor progression.
    consequence: Decreased progression-free survival.
    probability: 90
    explanation: The presence of metastasis in stage IV colon adenocarcinoma is likely to decrease progression-free survival due to the challenges in treating metastatic cancer.
    novelty: 0

conclusion:
  outcome: 4 months of progression-free survival
  explanation: Given the patient's stage IV colon adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated histology, metastasis, and carcinomatosis, and considering the effectiveness of the optimal standard of care treatment, the expected progression-free survival is estimated to be around 4 months. This estimate is based on the provided examples and the simulation steps, which take into account the molecular, cellular, and organ-level processes impacting tumor progression.
