parameters:
  - age: 72
  - cancer_stage: III
  - cancer_location: left side of the colon
  - differentiation: moderately differentiated
  - metastasis: yes
  - carcinomatosis: yes
  - treatment: optimal standard of care

simulation:
  - step: 1
    level: molecular
    facts: The Wnt signaling pathway is often dysregulated in colon adenocarcinoma, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth [1]. Moderately differentiated tumors have a better prognosis than poorly differentiated tumors [2]. Carcinomatosis is associated with a worse prognosis [3].
    entities: Wnt signaling pathway, cell proliferation, tumor growth
    assumptions: The patient's tumor has dysregulated Wnt signaling, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. The moderately differentiated histology suggests a better prognosis than poorly differentiated tumors, but the presence of carcinomatosis indicates a worse prognosis.
    consequence: The optimal standard of care treatment plan will target the dysregulated Wnt signaling pathway and other molecular processes to reduce tumor growth and metastasis.
    probability: 80
    explanation: The treatment plan is likely to be effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis due to its targeting of the dysregulated Wnt signaling pathway and other molecular processes.
    novelty: 20

  - step: 2
    level: cellular
    facts: Chemotherapy, such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, is a common treatment for stage III colon adenocarcinoma [4]. These treatments target rapidly dividing cancer cells, leading to cell death and reduced tumor growth [5].
    entities: chemotherapy, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, cancer cells, cell death
    assumptions: The patient receives chemotherapy as part of the optimal standard of care treatment plan, targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells and leading to cell death.
    consequence: The chemotherapy treatment reduces tumor growth and metastasis, improving the patient's prognosis.
    probability: 70
    explanation: Chemotherapy is effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis by targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells and inducing cell death.
    novelty: 10

  - step: 3
    level: tissue
    facts: Tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression and response to therapy [6]. Inflammation and immune cell infiltration can impact the effectiveness of treatment [7].
    entities: tumor microenvironment, inflammation, immune cell infiltration
    assumptions: The patient's tumor microenvironment, including inflammation and immune cell infiltration, influences the effectiveness of the optimal standard of care treatment plan.
    consequence: The patient's tumor microenvironment may either enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the treatment, impacting the progression-free survival.
    probability: 60
    explanation: The tumor microenvironment can either enhance or hinder the effectiveness of treatment, depending on factors such as inflammation and immune cell infiltration.
    novelty: 40

conclusion:
  outcome: Based on the provided examples and the simulation, the expected progression-free survival for this patient is approximately 8 months.
  explanation: The patient's moderately differentiated tumor and the presence of carcinomatosis suggest a prognosis between examples 2 and 3. The optimal standard of care treatment plan, including chemotherapy, is expected to reduce tumor growth and metastasis, but the tumor microenvironment may influence the effectiveness of the treatment.
