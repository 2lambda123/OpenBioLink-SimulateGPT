# Expert Feedback Form Generation

## Summary
The script (expert_feedback_form_generator.py) generates, based on an annotation file (annotation.csv) containing 
- experiment and prompt names
- and a text file with questions (questions.txt), 

a fully formatted feedback form as Excel file.

For each experiment, three sheets are generated including all provided prompts and their output generated by using direct inference (baseline) or SimulateGPT (high-complexity).

The three sheets differ in the shown output:
- {experiment}_OUT includes only the final outcome
- {experiment}_EXP includes only the final outcome and the respective explanation
- {experiment}_SIM includes the complete simulation

The rows in each experiment sheet are randomized and the ground truth is retained in the last three columns (to be removed before sending out for assessment) for computational evaluation of results.

The generated Excel file serves as feedback form for experts to judge the qualitative performance of the GPT-4 outputs.

## Requirements (python modules)
- pandas
- yaml
- os
- XlsxWriter (only pip install worked)

## Input
expert_feedback/
- annotation.csv with two columns: _experiment_ and _prompt_ (it leverages and depends on the existing experiment directory structure)
- questions.txt, where every line is a question/statement to be included into the feedback form.
- likert_scale.png visualizing the likert scale and will be added to the top left corner of the feedback_form.xlsx

## Usage
- execute from root of the repository
- no arguments required

## Output
expert_feedback/
- feedback_form.xlsx
